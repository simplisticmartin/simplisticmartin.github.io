# This is Boxing

Professionally and typically, hobbies and what you love shouldn't be part of what is professional but there is an element of boxing that is applicable to being professional in my opinion. Right now, I am talking about two of boxing's elite's Deontay Wilder, the champion of the WBC championship belt and the lineal champion, Tyson Fury. These guys are special with something that most do not have. I am not talking about them being 6 foot 7 and 6 foot 9 but what they have. They are special characters with a special aura of charisma, willing to put everything on the line for the sake of entertainment and a stake to claim to be the best on the planet. 

## The Match and the setup

These heavyweight titans have clashed once before in 2018 in a very exciting bout. Deontay, the atomic bomb in the right hand and Tyson Fury with some of the slickest boxing not only in the heavyweight but in all of the division. Tyson Fury showed a clinic school of boxing on the night winning with style points. Wilder knocked the lineal champion almost out cold twice. Tyson Fury rose off the deck to win the rest of the round. My opinion? Tyson Fury won 10 rounds to 2 and with fair scoring it should be 116-110(in favor of Fury) due to the fact that a knock down is counted as 2 points.


## Tyson Fury

The British Champion. The world lineal champion with a strong set of boxing skills. He has strong character and charisma. Before this bout happened, he struggled with depression and did drugs and life went into a downward spiral and he ballooned up over 28 stones. He learned to face his demons and overcome depression. Do and just keep working in the gym as thats the only way he's learned to have continous battles with his demons. It's not about just achieving your goals but also setting a new journey and consistency when you are done with the first one. He knocked out Tom Schwarz and had a close slightly controversial fight with Otto Wallin. He believes he will place the decision of the fight in his own hands and knock wilder out. I find the likely hood of Fury winning by knockout is low but points as long as he stays away from the wicked eraser. Oh and he has a perfect record aside from tie of 29-0-1(Over half by knockouts).

## Deontay Wilder

The American Boxer with a strong sense of character and self belief to succeed. He is a wicked knockout (artist) as one calls it. He has a record of 42-0-1. Both of the ties are from each other. Deontay Wilder has 41 knockouts and has knocked out everybody on his resume aside from Tyson Fury. We all think that or a majority(90%+) boxing fans believe if he were to claim victory, he would catch Tyson Fury clean like he has done so in his last two fights against Dominic Breazeale(in 1 round) and Luis Ortiz(in 7 rounds). This is a dangerous boxer with strong convictions.
