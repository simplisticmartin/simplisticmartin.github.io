        <title>Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder (With Statistics Breakdown)</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-is-boxing&quot;&gt;This is Boxing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionally and typically, hobbies and what you love shouldn’t be part of what is professional but there is an element of boxing that is applicable to being professional in my opinion. Right now, I am talking about two of boxing’s elite’s Deontay Wilder, the champion of the WBC championship belt and the lineal champion, Tyson Fury. These guys are special with something that most do not have. I am not talking about them being 6 foot 7 and 6 foot 9 but what they have. They are special characters with a special aura of charisma, willing to put everything on the line for the sake of entertainment and a stake to claim to be the best on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-match-and-the-setup&quot;&gt;The Match and the setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These heavyweight titans have clashed once before in 2018 in a very exciting bout. Deontay, the atomic bomb in the right hand and Tyson Fury with some of the slickest boxing not only in the heavyweight but in all of the division. Tyson Fury showed a clinic school of boxing on the night winning with style points. Wilder knocked the lineal champion almost out cold twice. Tyson Fury rose off the deck to win the rest of the round. My opinion? Tyson Fury won 10 rounds to 2 and with fair scoring it should be 116-110(in favor of Fury) due to the fact that a knock down is counted as 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tyson-fury&quot;&gt;Tyson Fury&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Champion. The world lineal champion with a strong set of boxing skills. He has strong character and charisma. Before this bout happened, he struggled with depression and did drugs and life went into a downward spiral and he ballooned up over 28 stones. He learned to face his demons and overcome depression. Do and just keep working in the gym as thats the only way he’s learned to have continous battles with his demons. It’s not about just achieving your goals but also setting a new journey and consistency when you are done with the first one. He knocked out Tom Schwarz and had a close slightly controversial fight with Otto Wallin. He believes he will place the decision of the fight in his own hands and knock wilder out. I find the likely hood of Fury winning by knockout is low but points as long as he stays away from the wicked eraser. Oh and he has a perfect record aside from tie of 29-0-1(Over half by knockouts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deontay-wilder&quot;&gt;Deontay Wilder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Boxer with a strong sense of character and self belief to succeed. He is a wicked knockout (artist) as one calls it. He has a record of 42-0-1. Both of the ties are from each other. Deontay Wilder has 41 knockouts and has knocked out everybody on his resume aside from Tyson Fury. We all think that or a majority(90%+) boxing fans believe if he were to claim victory, he would catch Tyson Fury clean like he has done so in his last two fights against Dominic Breazeale(in 1 round) and Luis Ortiz(in 7 rounds). This is a dangerous boxer with strong convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-and-statistics&quot;&gt;Data and Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>The beginning of my blogging ventures</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;beginning-of-my-blogging-ventures&quot;&gt;Beginning of my Blogging Ventures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a long time to set up a Blogging system. Especially without a database or backend technology. I wanted to incorporate it in a single place where I can focus my attention to. I found Jekyll and this theme which reminds me of medium which is a popular blogging platform which I find myself sometimes looking towards to for advice. The reason I didn’t use medium is because this blog is just about me. If I wanted to take pictures and share it here, I can without guilt and unapologetically so. I can’t just make a random blog post about a cute puppy on medium so for those reasons alone, it strayed me off that platform. This blogging system is to document what I have learned and what I know so far. Thank you to Mediator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;plans&quot;&gt;Plans&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;course-reviews&quot;&gt;Course Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many courses from various websites such as udacity, codeacademy, coursera, edx, udemy and the lists go on and on. I really would prefer to acquire those knowledge but its hard to keep focused but I desire to do so so I will finish courses to make sure I can properly review them. I want to take concepts in these courses and break them down well.
Its boring and tedious. Theres no fast way to really do this. I just find that if you find different ways to break down, material preferably with hands on work, the process becomes much more buttery smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;job-preparation&quot;&gt;Job Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process will be boring but to have success it has to move forward. I have to hit ball parks, create applications and improving my interview skills. I want to document this process. I have a camera which I can record this or I can simply Blog about it. Which ever way I slice it, I have to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books-i-have-read&quot;&gt;Books I have read&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self help books are my favorite genre. So generally speaking, I like non-fiction. I never got into the habit of reading other books for that reason, I haven’t watched movies as well. I watched a movie every couple of months if I get called out to. There is too much content being created and as we speak probably dozens of movies aunorderd listsre made in the process. I mean hollywood blockbusters not indie films(Can you imagine?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-and-explained-concepts&quot;&gt;Technology and Explained Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical and non-applicable ways to learn technology isn’t ever so fun to me but If I ever get them down, I like to break them down. To levels in which I hope normal everyday humans can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-made-tutorials&quot;&gt;Self-made tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I do X to achieve Y? I have always wanted to share my knowledge like I said. It takes being immersed and breaking down things several times to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hobbies-and-other-things&quot;&gt;Hobbies and other things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to have fun.(who doesn’t?). If I make progress in a day of dancing or boxing or something of that nature I like to share it. If I watch a sport session and it gets my heart racing, I’d like that too to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-issues-and-solutions&quot;&gt;Life issues and solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course everyday, everybody on planet earth and namek has issues. me included and your favorite president of course. We all want solutions to our personal problems with the additional addition of results. I’d like to share things that made me right from whenI was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quotes-of-the-day&quot;&gt;Quotes of the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this quote and I want to remind myself of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All we really own in life are moments in time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
